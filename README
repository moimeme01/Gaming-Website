This is a personal project designated to create a website for playing games like Tusmo, skyjo, ect
with the people invited by a gameCode.

The goal of the site is that, one person launch a room, then get a code and invite other people with this code, then
all the persons who have the code will automatically join this room. After that, they will choose a game and play.

All the data (game duration, points, ...) will be stored in the database.

I still don't know if I'll make the access through an account or simply via the ip address of the device.

The database are created using MySQL preventing any use of an external server.
To see the values in the DB, open the terminal and put:
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U admin -d visitorjournal

then all the commands are the following:
\ds for opening the db
SELECT * FROM visitorjournal;


To kill all the active profiles on url open terminal then insert the following line:
lsof -i :8000
then:
kill <ID>
